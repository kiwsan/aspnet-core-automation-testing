# Best Automations Testing for .NET

Work in progress.

## Unit Test
In computer programming, [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

## Integration Test
[Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.

## Acceptance Test
In engineering and its various subdisciplines, [Acceptance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. It may involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests.
